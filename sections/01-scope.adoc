== Scope

This document provides the CalConnect patent policy, which governs all
standardization deliverables developed through the CalConnect
standardization process.

The CalConnect patent policy is identical to the <<ISOPP>> in content,
except where:

* entity names such as "`ISO`", "`IEC`", "`ITU-T`" and "`ITU-R`" were
  changed to "`CalConnect`";

* deliverables and processes pertaining to those entities have been
  changed to their counterparts within CalConnect.

Detailed arrangements arising from patents (licensing, royalties, etc.)
are left to the parties concerned, as these arrangements might differ
from case to case.
