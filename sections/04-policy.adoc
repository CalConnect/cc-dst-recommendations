== Patent information transparency policy

CalConnect does not provide authoritative or comprehensive information
about evidence, validity or scope of patents or similar rights.

However, the fullest available information shall be disclosed in any CalConnect-published standard.

Therefore, any party participating in the work of CalConnect shall,
from the outset, draw the attention of the Executive Director and TCC
of CalConnect, to any known patent or to any known pending patent
application, either their own or of other organizations, although
CalConnect is unable to verify the validity of any such information.

In a joint deliverable developed with other standardization bodies,
IPR requirements of all such standardization bodies who will be
publishing the deliverable shall be satisfied.
