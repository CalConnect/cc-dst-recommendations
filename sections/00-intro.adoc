== Introduction

=== General

CalConnect is committed in expanding the realm of standards
in collaborative technologies with a focus on interoperability
across the globe and communities of practice.

As a proponent of open standards, CalConnect does not endorse
mandatory usage of patents within CalConnect Standards.
The CalConnect Board of Directors has decided to align
IPR practice with major international standardization bodies
including ISO, IEC and ITU.

=== Purpose

This document describes the policy of CalConnect with regards to patent
usage within CalConnect deliverables and provides a
"`code of practice`" that is simple and straightforward.

CalConnect deliverables are drawn up by technical, not patent, experts,
who may not be fully aware of all nuisances in the complex
international legal situation of intellectual property rights.

CalConnect deliverables are non-binding -- their objective is to ensure
compatibility of technologies and systems on a worldwide basis.

To meet this objective, which is in the common interests of all those
participating, it must be ensured that the usage and continued
application of CalConnect deliverables are accessible to everybody.

Therefore, a patent embodied fully or partly in a CalConnect
deliverable must be accessible to everybody without undue constraints.
