== Summary

The European Commission has proposed, after public consultation, its member states to discontinue daylight savings time (DST), effective October 2019. Its member states have to decide whether to implement the change by March 2019. Several governments and organizations have since expressed concerns on such a tight timeline for the far-reaching change.

https://calconnect.org[The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium], a global non-profit organization widely known as https://calconnect.org[CalConnect], shares these concerns and recommends the European Commission to extend the timelines stated in the proposal.

Specifically, we recommend providing a transition period of at least one year (12 months) after the final decision of the change has been set. CalConnect will host a public workshop at its next conference, and has just launched a public mailing list for the discussion of best practices for planning new time zone changes.
